    <h1>Cinnamon Pie</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <li>8 oz cream cheese</li>
    <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
    <li>2 large eggs + 1 yolk</li>
    <li>1.25 cups heavy cream</li>
    <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>3.5 tbsp ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 pie crust</li>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Roll and fit a pie crust into a standard 9 inch pie dish. Crimp the edges and place the pie crust in the refrigerator.</li>
    <li>Place the cream cheese and brown sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer. Beat on high until light and fluffy, about 3-5 minutes. Scrape the bowl with a spatula, then beat in the eggs. Scrape the bowl again, then set the mixer on low and mix in cream, flour, cinnamon, vanilla, salt and nutmeg until very smooth.</li>
    <li>Pour the cinnamon filling into the prepared pie pan. Bake for 35 minutes, until the center seems set when jiggled, but not totally firm. Bake another 5 minutes if needed. Cool completely. Cover and chill.</li>
    <li>Take out of the refrigerator 1 hour before serving. Dust the top of the pie with powdered sugar. Cut and serve with whipped cream if desired.</li>
</ol>
